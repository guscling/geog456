    <h1>GEOG 456 Assignment 8</h1>
    <h2>Comparing NAID images of Downtown Raleigh across in 2012, 2016, and 2022</h2>
    <p>Overall, there were not a lot of major changes in Downtown Raleigh noticable from these images between 2012 and 2022. Towards the eastern endge of the image there were some houses built and some major roads were expanded but the overall layout of the area visible in the images has remained relatively static over the last decade.  Changes in layout would be very noticeable in other parts of Raleigh due it growing so quickly, and the downtown has changed a lot since 2012, just not in ways visible from an areal view.</p>
